Low Level FIX
=============

This project aims to provide very low level modules which can be combined to produce a FIX protocol handler (server, client, router, etc.).

Consider the current implementation, at best, late alpha quality.  There is almost no documentation, optimizations, etc.  This is little more than a code dump at this point.

See various tests for examples on using this code.

Contributions welcome.

TODO:
-Make sure netty handlers are sane (ignore FIX logic for now)
-Document (javadocs)
-Make sure existing logic works correctly (add more standard FIX test cases)
-Add new functionality such as groups, crash proof resend logic, etc.
