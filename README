Low Level FIX
=============

This project aims to provide very low level modules which can be combined to produce a FIX protocol handler (server, client, router, etc.).

Consider the current implementation, at best, late alpha quality.  There is almost no documentation, optimizations, etc.  This is little more than a code dump at this point.

See various tests for examples on using this code.

Contributions welcome.
